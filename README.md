# VR Arduino
Interactive VR Arduino Technology

## Overview
This repository showcases an interactive experience developed during the **"Interactive Journey into Emerging Technologies"** workshop, part of the Tuwaiq Talk series. The project combines **Virtual Reality (VR)** with **Arduino Uno** to demonstrate how emerging technologies can be integrated to create innovative, hands-on tech experiences.

## Objectives
- Integrate **VR** with **Arduino** for interactive simulations and control.
- Explore real-world applications of **emerging technologies** in design and development.
- Provide a creative space where **programming**, **electronics**, and **3D environments** come together.
- Encourage experimentation and rapid prototyping of future tech ideas.

## Requirements
To replicate or extend this project, ensure you have the following:

- Unity (latest version, preferably 2022+)
- Arduino IDE
- Arduino Uno board
- USB cable (for Arduino connection)
- VR headset (optional, for immersive testing)
- High-spec laptop (preferably a gaming laptop for optimal performance)

## Topics Covered
- Serial communication between Unity and Arduino
- VR interaction design basics
- Sensor input (e.g., motion, buttons) to trigger events in VR
- Cross-disciplinary integration (hardware + software)
